Python program to return if given number is even or odd

    n = int(input("enter the number to check whether the given number is even or odd :"))
// takes the input value
    if(n%2==0) ://here % function returns the remainder value 
// checks whether the given condition is true or not
// if condition is true then below set of statements are executed 
            print(n, "is even")
// prints that the number is even
        else:
// if the condition is false then below statements are executed
              print(n, " is odd ") 
// prints that the number is odd
   






Bonus question:
       n= int(input(" Enter the numberto check if it is even or odd "))
// takes the input 
       print(" The number is even"*(n%2 == 0) ) // here
// if the condition n%2==0 is true , prints the number is even
       print(" The number is odd"*(n%2! =0))
// if the condition n%2!=0 is true , prints the number is odd
